xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

This project originates from the MIT course mit6.s081 and includes personal code for each lab, 
solely intended for learning and exchange purposes.
